# About Liam's random quote generator

This application is one of the five projects in the [Front end development libraries curriculum](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/#front-end-development-libraries-projects).

It leverages [lukePeavey's random quote API](https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable) to fetch quotes.

Styling was performed using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).
